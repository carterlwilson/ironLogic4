As of now, the tokens used by users in the mobile app seem to expire pretty quickly.
For this application it's painful for the user to have to log out and back
in frequently. Plan out some possible solutions for solving this issue.
The desired behavior is that once the user is logged in to their account on the 
mobile app, they should never have to manually log out and in to refresh a token.
