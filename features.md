_Stay in plan mode.

I'd like to add a fairly complicated feature here in the mobile app. 
In most gyms, weights are color coded as follows:
red - 25 kg
blue - 20 kg
yellow - 15 kg
green - 10 kg
white - 5 kg
also, the bar itself weighs 20 kg or 15 kg
I'd like to add a tool to the workout section that will show a client
the combination of weights and colors on a barbell that will be needed to build the 
weight they need to use. Notes here:
- the weights will be on barbells, so the weight needs to be evenly
   distributed on both sides of the bar
- if the weight can't be divided evenly into the given amounts,
  then round it down until it can. 
- This should be launched by a button underneath the recommended
   weight card for a given weight activity. 
- Within this tool, the client should be able to switch between the 
   15 and 20 kg barbell and see the configurations with each barbell.

Have the frontend engineer plan out this feature. I'd like to see specifics of the 
algorithm they will use to figure out the weights on the bar._
