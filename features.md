Go into plan mode.

I'm getting the following error in git when I try to pull 
the latest changes from the remote:

error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/carterlwilson/ironLogic4.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind                                                                    
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

What can I do to fix this? I want to keep my current local changes
