Go into plan mode.

On the mobile page right now, when a client is looking at their benchmarks,
there is one button for adding/editing benchmarks for a group of rep maxes.
This doesn't match the new benchmark structure. Instead of that button,
the user needs to be able to tap on a rep max to edit it or create a new one. 
The age validation (can only edit if <20 days old) should apply at a rep max level,
since it's possible for different rep maxes to be recorded on different dates.
Plan this implementation.
