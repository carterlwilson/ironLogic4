Go into plan mode

Have the UI designer create an implementation plan (just the plan) for creating the activity management UI page. 
This page should be available to a gym owner in the nav panel when they are logged in. I'd like for it to be a tabbed page
on which one tab can be used to view, create, edit, and delete activity groups, and the other can be used to view, create, edit, or delete
activity templates. When creating or editing an activity template, the group ID assignment should be done through 
a select that shows the name of the activity groups.
