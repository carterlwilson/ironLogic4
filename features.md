Go into plan mode.

Ok, even after all that simplification, when I try to re-order a non-lift activity
in a day in the program builder, it adds a sets field with an empty array to 
the non-lift activity. I was able to confirm with the dev console that the
sets field is ONLY present after the re-order. Why?
