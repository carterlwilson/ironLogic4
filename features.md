Go into plan mode.

The login endpoint seems to be working now, so that's good. However, 
the username and password you set up for admin user isn't able to log in for somme 
reason. Can you double check that the password was hashed correctly, and fill me
in again on how that works? I wanted the password to be password123 and the username
is carterlwilson@gmail.com
