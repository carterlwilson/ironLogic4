Go into plan mode.

I'd like to start planning out how to get this application into a hosted
preprod setting in the cloud (deploy it to preprod, basically). I don't want
to self-host, so I'll need something hosted. Knowing what you know about 
the tech stack for this project and the way it's structured, can you recommend
and compare some cloud stack hosting options, including the db? One consideration:
All parts of the project use shared data models, but I'd like to be able 
to re-deploy the client or server or mobile app without having to re-deploy all
the others if I need to make a change.
