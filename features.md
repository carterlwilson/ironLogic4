I'd like the UI design specialist to design the overall page for the client app. They should only create a design, not implement it. They should write out their design to a file with the name of their choice. I'd like a nave menu on the left side of the page. Depending on what type of user is logged in, there will be different nav routes. For now, an admin user should have a nav option called 'Users'. Also for now, coach, owner, and client users should have no options available to them. For the 'Users' nav option (only available to admin users, so no other user should be able to access that route), route to placeholder content. The entire app should have the nav menu layout.
